SCRIPT NAME:       CreateTeams.ps1

AUTHOR:            Scott Croucher

VERSION:           0.1a

VERSION HISTORY:   February 2018 - Script creation

PRE-REQUISITES:    MicrosoftTeams and AzureAD Modules loaded into Powershell

EXAMPLE:           .\CreateTeams.ps1 -Owners “owner1emailaddress”, “owner2emailaddress” -TeamName “TeamName” -TeamDescription “This is the name of the team” -Channels “Channel1”, “Channel2” -Members “membersemailaddress” 

.DESCRIPTION
Use this script with the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell version 0.9.0 beta module to create a team with members and channels that you specify. Also leverages the AzureAD module to find all members to add.
.PARAMETER Owners
The comma-separated list of owners for your Team, who handle team settings and membership management. The owners should be specified by their User Principal Name. You must specify a minimum of two owners.
.PARAMETER TeamName
The name of your company-wide team. For example, this could be your company name.
.PARAMETER TeamDescription
The description of your company-wide team, in quotes.
.PARAMETER Channels
The comma-separated list of names of all the initial channels you want to set up. For example: "Announcements","Social at Work","Teamwork at Contoso".
.PARAMETER GroupID
If you have already created the group for your company-wide team, specify its GroupID. You can get this value from the display of the “Get-AzureADGroup | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName,ObjectID” command. This script had an issue during the rest of the execution and stopped early. 
.PARAMETER Members
The comma-separated list of members for your team that you want to manually add. To use this script a minimum of two members must be added. The members should be specified by their User Principal Name. To manually just add a single member, use the “Add-TeamUser -GroupId $IdOfGroup -Role Member -User $member” command.
